Build the program with:
sbt package

Run the program with

Key Assumptions:

-a reservation must be placed in a contiguous block in a row
-preferences of rows follows a log normal distribution
-preferences of columns is essentially the more in the middle, the better
-aisle seats are slightly preferable to non-aisle seats
-a customer is more satisfied if they have an empty seat next to them
-a customer does not care if someone with a higher reservation number than
	themselves who is requesting the same number of seats gets "better" seats
-the "optimal" solution cannot be obtained, but an estimate will suffice
